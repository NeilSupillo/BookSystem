Bookstore Management System

- Developed a React.js, Tailwind CSS, Asp.Net Core, MySQL book management system that
  allows users to easily create, edit, and manage book records.
- Built the backend using a RESTful CRUD API, utilizing Axios to connect and fetch data from a
  MySQL database for storing book information.
- Enhanced the system with search functionality, enabling users to search for books by title or
  author for efficient book discovery.
